- 👋 Hi, I’m @kasia-chodak.
- 👀 I’m a bioinformatics student interested in medicine, biology and IT.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C++ and Python at the uni, but sometimes I use JavaScript too for personal projects. 
- 💞️ I’m shy and I know too little to collaborate with anyone, so maybe another time! ^^"
- 📫 How to reach me - if >>really<< necessary, write to me here: k_a_t_a_r_z_y_n_a_.m.chodak4444@gmail.com (remove all "_" symbols before)
